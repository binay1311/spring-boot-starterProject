I havent downloaded and installed postgresql for creating database since postgres installation errors out if we have antivirus enabled.

1. I have first created a docker container using
docker run -d --rm --name student -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres:12

2. Then run the springboot application from intellij by commenting out sprinboot-jpa starter dependency.

3. then create a server in pgadmin
name it student
Host name/address : localhost
Port : 5432
username : postgres
password : admin

(username and password should be copied from your springboot's application.properties)

4. Add 
    @Id
    @SequenceGenerator(
            name = "student_sequence",
            sequenceName = "student_sequence",
            allocationSize = 1
    )
    @GeneratedValue(
            strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE,
            generator = "student_sequence"
    )
 in class Student.java

5. uncomment sprinboot -jpa dependency and Try to re-run the springboot application to create student table but it will error out since there isn't any student database.

6. go to pgadmin : student : Query Editor: now create the database (CREATE DATABASE student;)

7. now again run the springboot application, you can see in the console that the table student gets created

Now we want to import the database in intellij
8. Go to intellij : Database(top right corner) : Import Data Sources

9. import demo/hibernate , test the connection , it will be connected and hence database is imported in intellij
